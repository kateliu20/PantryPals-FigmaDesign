INTRODUCTION:
Pantry in a Pinch is a safer, more secure method to food access and nutrition.

Food insecurity is a rampant and growing issue that has been perpetuated by the pandemic. According to the NCBI and NPR, 45% of higher education students experience food insecurity, and 54 million people in the US are estimated to be food insecure because of the pandemic. The result of this can lead to a multitude of health problems and mental health disorders, which ultimately affects school and job performance, and causes poor health. 

In addition, there exists a large social stigma when it comes to food aid: shame is actually the most dominant feature in modern poverty. According to The Guardian, 1 in 4 people who are eligible for food stamps don't sign up as a result of shame, which leads to  food waste, too. These factors incentivise the absolute need for an application that provides anonymity, and security when getting food from local banks and donation centers.

With the pandemic, it is far more difficult to go grocery shopping or afford delivery options, which leaves low-income families with the struggle to access vegetables, fruits, grains, or a simple nutritious meal. The combination of COVID-19 and the existing struggles low-income families and students already have to face catalyze the urgency for a solution, now. 

Introducing Pantry in a Pinch: a mobile application that provides students, families, and homeless populations an opportunity to order comprehensive meal plans from food banks for pickup under empowering aliases that will reduce the stigma and possible shame associated with food insecurity. 

DESIGN:
We used Figma for the design, and Canva for assistance with the color palette and some graphics.
